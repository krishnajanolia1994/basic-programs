//if execution time of a function  is less than contaxt switching of that function then we use inline fuction becuse of following  resson
// * when compiler find any function as inline function then it subtitute fuction calling statement by body of that funtion and do not pass control to that funtion
// it increase the efficiency of program but on same hand it increase the space requirement of program
// we should make small size function inline
